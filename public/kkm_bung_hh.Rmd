This data comes from phone surveys collected by Vyxer REMIT Kenya in partnership with Tufts University. Please contact julie.powers@tufts.edu and amy.pickering@tufts.edu with any questions.

_Study area:_ Villages are enrolled that are located in Bungoma or Kakamega counties and were previously enrolled in WASH Benefits Kenya (W, WSH, WSHN, AC, PC arms only). 

_Eligibility:_ Respondents are eligible if they are women 50 years of age or younger, have had a child since January 1, 2008, and live in an eligible village.

_Study design:_ Respondents were visited in person by our team for another study, between July 2019 and March 2020 (when data collection was halted due to COVID-19). During this time, we censused 575 out of 730 eligible villages, and enrolled and surveyed 34,098 eligible women. We are following up with a subset of these women by phone. The final sample size for this phone survey will depend on the trajectory of COVID-19 in the study area and funding constraints. We have divided the respondents who provided a phone number (N = 29,301) into seven random survey rounds of equal size. Each survey round will have the same proportion of respondents from each geographic block. Respondents selected are geographically representative for each survey round, but are not geographically representative on a weekly basis. For this reason, weekly data should be interpreted with caution. We attempt to contact each respondent five times.

_Sample size to date:_  We have interviewed 1,844 respondents to-date, all from survey round 1. Our response rate (number of surveys completed/number of respondents we have attempted to contact) is 69%.
