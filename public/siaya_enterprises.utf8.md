These data comes from phone survey interviews conducted by [REMIT Kenya](http://remitkenya.co.ke/) in Siaya County, Kenya. We are collecting data for a sample of ~5,000 enterprises in the county, which is representative of the whole population of enterprises. At the same time, our weekly sampling method assures weekly representativeness of the overall sample.

So far we have interviewed 1,770 enterprises, with the following distribution per week:
