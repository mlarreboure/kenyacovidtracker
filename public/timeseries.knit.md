### Income  
<font size="5">**Earnings per capita (USD, PPP) - past 14 days**</font>

Households are assigned the high asset category if they reported higher asset holdings than the median household in a 2014-2015 baseline survey. Asset holdings data is only available for the 2014-2015 survey sample, which is a subsample of the current panel of households.

  This plot aggregates income from each of the three earning sources, across all working-age household members, stacking them to add to the average earning per capita, including children, in the past 14 days. If the household does not perceive income from one or more of the sources, those data points are assigned zeros to assure representativeness for the whole population.

  This plot aggregates income from each of the three earning sources, across all working-age household members, stacking them to add to the average earning per capita, including children, in the past 14 days. If the household does not perceive income from one or more of the sources, those data points are assigned zeros to assure representativeness for the whole population.

### COVID-19  

<font size="5">**Reported COVID-19 Behavior Adoption**</font> 

Households are assigned the high asset category if they reported higher asset holdings than the median household in a 2014-2015 baseline survey. Asset holdings data is only available for the 2014-2015 survey sample, which is a subsample of the current panel of households.  

####  {.tabset .tabset-pills}

##### All

We ask respondents whether they have changed their behavior in any way since learning about COVID-19, and if so, how  it has changed.

### Labor Supply

<font size="5">**Weekly labor supply (hours per household adult)**</font>

Households are assigned the high asset category if they reported higher asset holdings than the median household in a 2014-2015 baseline survey. Asset holdings data is only available for the 2014-2015 survey sample, which is a subsample of the current panel of households.

  This plot aggregates hours worked on each of the three sources, across all working-age household members, stacking them to add to the average weekly labor supply per household adult. If the household does not work any hours on one or more of the labor categories, those data points are assigned zeros to assure representativeness of the whole population.

### Children Education  

<font size="5">**Children educational activities**</font> 

Households are assigned the high asset category if they reported higher asset holdings than the median household in a 2014-2015 baseline survey. Asset holdings data is only available for the 2014-2015 survey sample, which is a subsample of the current panel of households.  

####  {.tabset .tabset-pills}

##### All

We ask what has each child been doing over the last 15 minutes, whether the child has done any learning-related activities in the past 24 hours, and if so, what kind of activity. From this question we also learn whether the child attended school.

### Household Violence


<font size="5">**Gender violence**</font>

Households are assigned the high asset category if they reported higher asset holdings than the median household in a 2014-2015 baseline survey. Asset holdings data is only available for the 2014-2015 survey sample, which is a subsample of the current panel of households.

Households are assigned the high asset category if they reported higher asset holdings than the median household in a 2014-2015 baseline survey. Asset holdings data is only available for the 2014-2015 survey sample, which is a subsample of the current panel of households.

**The Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale** (CES-D-10) is a 10-item Likert scale questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms in the past week. It includes three items on depressed affect, five items on somatic symptoms, and two on positive affect. Options for each item range from “rarely or none of the time” (score of 0) to “all of the time” (score of 3). Scoring is reversed for positive affect statements. Total scores can range from 0 to 30. **Higher scores suggest greater severity of symptoms.**

**The Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale** (CES-D-10) is a 10-item Likert scale questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms in the past week. It includes three items on depressed affect, five items on somatic symptoms, and two on positive affect. Options for each item range from “rarely or none of the time” (score of 0) to “all of the time” (score of 3). Scoring is reversed for positive affect statements. Total scores can range from 0 to 30. **Higher scores suggest greater severity of symptoms.**

Households are assigned the high asset category if they reported higher asset holdings than the median household in a 2014-2015 baseline survey. Asset holdings data is only available for the 2014-2015 survey sample, which is a subsample of the current panel of households. 

Eligible households are those that qualified for [GiveDirectly transfers](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/assets/miguel_research/88/GE-Paper_2019-12-18.pdf) by living in homes with thatched roofs in 2014. 
      
These data comes from phone survey interviews conducted by [REMIT Kenya](http://remitkenya.co.ke/) in Siaya County, Kenya. We are collecting data for a sample of ~11,000 households in the county, which is representative of the whole population. At the same time, our weekly sampling method assures weekly representativeness of the overall sample.

So far we have interviewed 8,582 households, with the following distribution per week:
