  This plot aggregates income from each of the three earning sources, across all working-age household members, stacking them to add to the average earning per capita, including children, in the past 14 days. If the household does not perceive income from one or more of the sources, those data points are assigned zeros to assure representativeness for the whole population.

### Mental health


<font size="5">**Depression, CES-D-10**</font>  

The Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) is a 10-item Likert scale questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms in the past week. It includes three items on depressed affect, five items on somatic symptoms, and two on positive affect. Options for each item range from “rarely or none of the time” (score of 0) to “all of the time” (score of 3). Scoring is reversed for positive affect statements. Total scores can range from 0 to 30. **Higher scores suggest greater severity of symptoms.**
