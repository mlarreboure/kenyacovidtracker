**The Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale** (CES-D-10) is a 10-item Likert scale questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms in the past week. It includes three items on depressed affect, five items on somatic symptoms, and two on positive affect. Options for each item range from “rarely or none of the time” (score of 0) to “all of the time” (score of 3). Scoring is reversed for positive affect statements. Total scores can range from 0 to 30. **Higher scores suggest greater severity of symptoms.**

Households are assigned the high asset category if they reported higher asset holdings than the median household in a 2014-2015 baseline survey. Asset holdings data is only available for the 2014-2015 survey sample, which is a subsample of the current panel of households. 

Eligible households are those that qualified for [GiveDirectly transfers](http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/assets/miguel_research/88/GE-Paper_2019-12-18.pdf) by living in homes with thatched roofs in 2014. 
      
These data comes from phone survey interviews conducted by [REMIT Kenya](http://remitkenya.co.ke/) in Siaya County, Kenya. We are collecting data for a sample of ~11,000 households in the county, which is representative of the whole population. At the same time, our weekly sampling method assures weekly representativeness of the overall sample.

So far we have conducted 17,374 household phone surveys, with the following distribution per week:
