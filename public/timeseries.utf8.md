These data comes from phone survey interviews conducted by [REMIT Kenya](http://remitkenya.co.ke/) in Siaya County, Kenya. We are collecting data for a sample of ~12,000 households in the county, which is representative of the whole population. At the same time, our weekly sampling method assures weekly representativeness of the overall sample.
