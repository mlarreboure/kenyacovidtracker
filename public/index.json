Its goal is to help policy makers in Kenya to craft both public health and economic responses to the crisis.\nHow? We are generating descriptive statistics on COVID-19, behavioral adaptations, and local economic activity. We are collecting information on travel and recent contacts, knowledge of COVID-19 mitigation measures, and whether the population is adhering to them. As the epidemic unfolds, news consumption, trust in government and authorities, and social cohesion within households (e.g. domestic violence) or villages may also be affected.Â All of these data is being collected through phone surveys in representative samples of different study areas, and we will be posting weekly updates to disseminate our findings in real time.\nWe are also putting together different sources of information to create a timeline of the measures the government is enforcing during this time. We will use temporal and geographic variation in our survey timings and locations to analyze policy changes associated with the pandemic.\nFinally, we developed useful survey instruments which we are making public here to potentially help others seeking to measure responses to the pandemic.\nThe research team is leaded by Edward Miguel, Johannes Haushofer, Dennis Egger and Michael Walker, and all the data collection is being carried out by REMIT Kenya.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"KECOVID emerges as an academic response to the lack of real-time data on the spread of COVID-19 and its economic fallout, particularly in rural African settings.
